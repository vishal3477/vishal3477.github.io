I am a graduate student pursuing PhD in Computer science and engineering department at Michigan State University. My interests lies in the field of Computer Vision and Deep learning. 
I am currently working on reverse engineering of generative models to parse the training parameters of the model just using the output generated image.
I am also working on the problem of Anti-deepfakes. Deepfake (Deep Learning + Fake) is a technique that can superimpose face images of a target person to a video or image of a source person to create a manipulated media form to perform analogous actions as the source. I am developing a deep learning model which would be able to detect deepfake images and video.
