Welcome! Glad you found me. <br/>

About me
======
I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer science and engineering department](http://www.cse.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://www.msu.edu/). My research interests lie in the field of Computer Vision, with particular interests in manipulation detection/localization, model parsing, generative modeling, and image generation. I also have some experience with object detection in the wild. I'm working under the guidance of [Dr. Xiaoming Liu](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~liuxm/index2.html) at [Computer Vision Lab (CVLAB)](http://cvlab.cse.msu.edu/). <br/>
I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical and Instrumentation Engineering from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), Pilani, India, in 2019.

Collaborators
======
I have collaborated with many experts in the computer vision field, namely [Dr. Xiaoming Liu](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~liuxm/index2.html), [Dr. Tal Hassner](https://talhassner.github.io/home/), [Dr. Xi Yin](https://xiyinmsu.github.io/) and [Dr. Sijia Liu](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/). I'm thankful for all the suggestions provided by everyone mentioned above. 

Summer internship/collaboration opportunities
======
I'm looking for internship and collaboration opportunities for summer 2023. If you want to discuss my research or any collaboration idea, I'm just an [email](mailto:asnanivi@msu.edu) away :). 

Interests other than sitting in front of a laptop
======
I love going for long drives.<br/>
When having small breaks from work, I like solving jigsaw puzzles or reading a book.<br/>
Football, badminton, and table tennis are some of the outdoor sports I like.
